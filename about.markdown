## From Bugs to Benchmarks: A Comprehensive Survey of Software Defect Datasets  
Hao-Nan Zhu, Robert M. Furth, Michael Pradel, and Cindy Rubio-GonzÃ¡lez

> Software defect datasets, which are collections of software bugs and their associated information, are essential resources for researchers and practitioners in software engineering, programming languages, computer systems, and artificial intelligence. Such datasets facilitate empirical research and enable standardized benchmarking for a wide range of techniques, including fault detection, fault localization, test generation, test prioritization, automated program repair, and emerging areas like agentic AI-based software development. Over the years, numerous software defect datasets with diverse characteristics have been developed, providing rich resources for the community, yet making it increasingly difficult to navigate the landscape. To address this challenge, this article provides a comprehensive survey of 132 software defect datasets. Our work aims to help researchers and practitioners identify datasets that best suit their needs, while also guiding future dataset creators by highlighting gaps between existing datasets and community demands. The survey discusses the scope of existing datasets, e.g., regarding the application domain of the buggy software, the types of defects, and the programming languages used. We also examine the construction of these datasets, including the data sources and construction methods employed. Furthermore, we assess the availability and usability of the datasets, validating their availability and examining how defects are presented. To better understand the practical uses of these datasets, we analyze the publications that cite them, revealing that the primary use cases are evaluations of new techniques and empirical research. Based on our comprehensive review of the existing datasets, this paper suggests potential opportunities for future research, including addressing underrepresented kinds of defects, enhancing availability and usability through better dataset organization, and developing more efficient strategies for dataset construction and maintenance.
